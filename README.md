# Spree Multi Vendor

This is a spree [multi vendor marketplace](https://spreecommerce.org/marketplace-ecommerce/) extension. It's a great starting point if you're building a marketplace on top of [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org). Our goal was flexibility to allow you to tweak it to your needs.

## Community edition vs Enterprise edition

If you need a product that has all of the features out of the box, such as supplier onboarding, Stripe Connect payment splitting and payouts, and doesn't require any custom development, we recommend using [Spree Enterprise Edition](https://spreecommerce.org/pricing/).

## Installation

Please [follow our Multi-Vendor quickstart guide](https://spreecommerce.org/docs/developer/multi-vendor/quickstart).
